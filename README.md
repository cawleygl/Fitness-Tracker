# Fitness-Tracker

## Description of Application
This application allows users to record and track their progress on workouts containing one or more exercises. Users enter the details of resistance or cardio workouts, and the application saves them to a MongoDB database, and allows them to view charts and graphs with the data from their latest 7 workouts. I created the back-end of this application using a particular front-end that was provided to me.
